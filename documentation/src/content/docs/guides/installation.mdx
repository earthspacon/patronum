import { PackageManagers } from 'starlight-package-managers';

<PackageManagers pkg='patronum' frame='none' />

## Usage

Just import method from the root module:

```js
import { throttle, splitMap } from 'patronum';
```

Or from the personal module:

```js
import { throttle } from 'patronum/throttle';
import { splitMap } from 'patronum/split-map';
```

> Except `patronum/debug`. It is only available by personal module import.

Be careful in the module naming:

- Method export always exports as named export in camelCase
- Module with the operator always named in param-case

## Tests and SSR support

For SSR it is very useful to automatically identify each store, so it is recommended to read article about [Stable Identifiers in Effector](https://effector.dev/en/explanation/sids/).

Tests can be written without SWC or Babel-plugins, but it is recommended to use them to simplify debug and development.

### SWC

Install [`@effector/swc-plugin`](https://effector.dev/en/api/effector/swc-plugin/) to your project then add it to `.swcrc`:

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://json.schemastore.org/swcrc",
  "jsc": {
    "experimental": {
      "plugins": [["@effector/swc-plugin", {}]]
    }
  }
}
```

### Babel

Just add `effector/babel-plugin` to your `.babelrc` or `babel.config.js` at the `"plugins"` section:

```json
{
  "plugins": ["effector/babel-plugin"]
}
```
